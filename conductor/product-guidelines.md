# Product Guidelines

## Visual Identity

- **Style:** Minimalist & Clean. The interface should prioritize clarity and ease of use, using whitespace effectively to display workout data and progress without overwhelming the user.
- **Color Palette:** A professional and motivating palette. Likely utilizing a primary brand color (e.g., a calm blue or energetic green) against a clean white or light gray background, with clear indicators for status (success, warning, error).
- **Typography:** Modern sans-serif fonts (like Inter or Sora as seen in `package.json`) for readability across devices.

## User Experience (UX) Principles

- **Efficiency:** Streamlined workflows for common tasks like logging a workout or assigning a plan.
- **Mobile-First:** Given the context of use (in a gym), the design must be fully responsive and optimized for mobile devices.
- **Immediate Feedback:** Interactive elements should provide instant visual confirmation (e.g., button states, toast notifications).

## Tone and Voice

- **Professional:** For trainer-facing interfaces, conveying competence and reliability.
- **Encouraging:** For student-facing interfaces, motivating them to complete their goals.
